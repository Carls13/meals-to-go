This project has 2 branches:

1. The **main** branch which contains the published app (you can see it in this [link](https://expo.dev/@carls13/MealsToGo))
   
2. The **extended-features** which contains the app with 2 more features: Google Maps integration and Stripe integration. These cannot be deployed so in order to test them, you have to run the app and the functions locally.
